                    <h2>Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, September-October 1887</p>
                    <p>oil on cotton, 44.5 cm x 37.2 cm</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh painted this self-portrait in the winter of 1887-88, when he had been in Paris for
                        almost two years. It is clear from the work that he had studied the technique of the
                        Pointillists and applied it in his own, original way. He placed the short stripes of paint in
                        different directions. Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo.</p>
                    <p>The painting is also one of Van Gogh's boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed
                        complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the
                        background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another. The red
                        pigment has faded, so the purple strokes are now blue, which means the contrast with the yellow
                        is less powerful.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Self-Portrait</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, July-August 1887</p>
                    <p>oil on canvas, 44.5 cm x 33.6 cm</p>
                    <p>During his time in Paris (1886-1888), Van Gogh painted more than 20 self-portraits. He probably
                        had very little money for models. That led him to take himself as an object of study. Here he
                        portrays himself as an artist in his blue smock-frock. This was what he wore when painting.</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh painted this on the back of a Study for 'The Potato Eaters', which he had made earlier
                        in Nuenen (NL). By doing that, he avoided the costs not only of a model but also of expensive
                        canvas.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-right" data-index="2">
                    <h2>Self-Portrait with Pipe</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, September-November 1886</p>
                    <p>oil on canvas, 46.0 cm x 38.0 cm</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh painted many self-portraits, more than 20 in Paris alone. In each one he looks
                        different. He saw these self-portraits as a way of practising the art of portraiture. So he
                        experimented with facial expressions, colours and forms.</p>
                    <p>In Paris, Van Gogh had discovered the work of Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886). He admired this
                        older French painter for his rich colour palette and thick application of paint.
                        In this self-portrait he tried out Monticelli's approach to colour and light effects. The pale
                        tones of his face stand out starkly against the warm, dark red background.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Self-Portrait</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, March-June 1887</p>
                    <p>oil on cardboard, 41 cm x 33 cm</p>
                    <p>Around the world, people recognise this man with a red beard and an earnest look in his eyes.
                        Vincent van Gogh painted about 35 self-portraits in total, most of them in Paris. For him, this
                        was a way of practising portrait painting. His intention was not to portray himself as
                        realistically as possible. He used the Neo-Impressionist style here, with short, rough
                        brushstrokes. These alternate with longer strokes, such as the orange in his beard.</p>
                    <p>The background was originally purple (a mix of red and blue), but the red pigment has discoloured
                        and has become almost completely transparent.</p>

                    <h2>Self-Portrait</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, March-June 1887</p>

                    <p>oil on cardboard, 19.1 cm x 14.1 cm</p>
                    <p>This self-portrait is one of the smallest oil paintings Van Gogh ever made. Actually, it's more
                        of an oil sketch than a finished painting. He has used a cheap piece of card and worked fast,
                        with fairly broad brushes.</p>
                    <p>The green of his eyes and the orange of his beard leap out at you. The effect is enhanced by his
                        use of mainly muted colours elsewhere in the picture. Originally, however, his face was more
                        colourful; research has revealed that a red pigment in the paint has faded over time.</p>

                    <p>oil on canvas, 92.7 cm x 73.9 cm</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh painted this still life in the psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy. For him, the painting
                        was mainly a study in colour. He set out to achieve a powerful colour contrast. By placing the
                        purple flowers against a yellow background, he made the decorative forms stand out even more
                        strongly. The irises were originally purple. But as the red pigment has faded, they have turned
                        blue. Van Gogh made two paintings of this bouquet. In the other still life, he contrasted purple
                        and pink with green.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, July 1887</p>
                    <p>oil on canvas, 43.2 cm x 36.2 cm</p>
                    <p>The huge sunflower is clearly the main subject of this painting. Van Gogh was very fond of this
                        flower. In southern France, he painted large bouquets of sunflowers. And during his earlier
                        Paris period, he devoted a series of still lifes to this subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>Van Gogh made this painting on the hill of Montmartre in Paris. In the background, a little bit
                        of the city is visible. On the left are the chimneys of the factories in the Clichy district. He
                        painted this city scene on the back of the painting Head of a Woman, which he had made earlier
                        in Nuenen (NL). This was a way of saving expensive linen canvas.</p>

                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, August-September 1886</p>
                    <p>oil on canvas, 46.5 cm x 38.4 cm</p>
                    <p>This is one of more than 35 flower still lifes that Van Gogh painted in Paris in the summer of
                        1886. He hoped that paintings of flowers would sell well. These were also exercises in the use
                        of colour and a loose style of painting.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this still life, he worked with strong colour contrasts in complementary colours, placing
                        green and red side by side, or blue and orange. Pairs like these form the basis of the colour
                        theory of Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863), an artist Van Gogh greatly admired.</p>

                    <h2>View of the Alpilles</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, 1890</p>
                    <p>oil on canvas, 33 cm x 28.5 cm</p>
                    <p>Bluish-purple mountains stand out against the sky. The rugged, bare rock faces contrast with the
                        charm of the flowering trees in the foreground. Van Gogh made this little painting in the walled
                        wheatfield next to the hospital in Saint-Rémy (FR). He could look out of his bedroom window onto
                        that field, with the Alpilles mountain range in the distance.
                    </p>
                    <p>He wrote to Theo, ' I could certainly do an entire series of these Alpilles, for having seen them
                        for a long time now I've got used to it a little.'</p>

                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Paris, June-July 1886</p>
                    <p>oil on cardboard, 35 cm x 27 cm</p>
                    <p>The bold, expressive brushstrokes and bright yellow flowers contrast with
                        the darker tones of the surrounding elements, highlighting the artist's growing mastery of color
                        theory and light. The transparent glass is subtly depicted, with light reflecting off its
                        surface, adding a sense of depth to the composition.
                    </p>
                    <p>The yellow roses in the painting likely carry symbolic meaning, representing themes of friendship
                        and love. Van Gogh, whose personal life was marked by loneliness, often used color to convey
                        emotional depth. The vibrant yellows stand out against the muted greens and browns, creating a
                        dynamic visual effect that conveys both energy and fragility. Through this piece, van Gogh
                        captures not only the beauty of everyday objects but also imbues them with emotional resonance,
                        making "Glass with Yellow Roses" a testament to his evolving style and emotional sensitivity
                        during his time in Paris.</p>

                    <h2>Park with Fence</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Arles, September 1888</p>
                    <p>pencil, reed pen and ink, on paper, 31.9 cm x 24.4 cm</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh had only just gone to live in the Yellow House when he sat down to draw in the park
                        opposite. He was stony broke and had no more paint, but he never let a day go by without
                        working.</p>
                    <p>The subject may not be particularly exciting: a few trees and bushes behind a fence. But it is
                        intriguing to see how Van Gogh handles it. Note the distinctive way in which he represents the
                        various types of vegetation: dots for the gravel, heart-shaped leaves for the tree on the left.
                        He was using reed pens in different widths.</p>

                    <h2>Avenue in a Park</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Arles, May 1888</p>
                    <p>chalk, pen and ink, on paper, 25.7 cm x 34.8 cm</p>
                    <p>he work features a tree-lined avenue that leads toward a distant horizon, bathed in warm
                        sunlight. Van Gogh's energetic brushstrokes and vibrant use of color—especially his vivid
                        yellows and greens—imbue the scene with a sense of movement and life, a hallmark of his later
                        style. His fascination with nature is evident as the trees, painted with bold, sweeping strokes,
                        appear to sway in the breeze, conveying both vitality and tranquility.
                    </p>
                    <p>The work exemplifies a emotional connection to the environment, blending realism with expressive
                        color to create a scene that is
                        both familiar and deeply personal. Through his use of dynamic brushwork and vivid color, van
                        Gogh transforms a simple park avenue into a powerful reflection on the beauty and impermanence
                        of life.</p>

                    <h2>Seated Zouave</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Arles, June 1888</p>
                    <p>pencil, reed pen and ink, watercolour, on paper, 49.3 cm x 61.2 cm</p>
                    <p>In June 1888, Van Gogh had a stroke of luck. He finally found someone who was willing to sit for
                        a portrait. It was an infantryman from the elite corps known as the Zouaves. This is one of the
                        drawings that he made of him.
                    </p>
                    <p>Van Gogh had difficulty with parts of the drawing: the cap, for example, appears to be sliding
                        off the soldier's head. And the eyes and nose did not turn out well. Is that because it had been
                        a while since he'd drawn a living model? Or was it because he hadn't used a reed pen for a long
                        time?</p>

                    <h2>Stairs in the Garden of the Asylum</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, May-June 1889</p>
                    <p>chalk, brush and oil paint and ink, on cardboard, 63.1 cm x 45.6 cm</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh probably had only a little bit of leftover paint when he made this in Saint-Rémy. He was
                        also out of canvas. So he used thinned oil paint on cardboard for this view of the garden of the
                        asylum. He had arrived only recently and was not yet allowed to work beyond the garden walls.
                        Later he was also permitted to draw and paint outside the complex.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here he used not only paint but also coloured ink, which has faded to brown. The paint has also
                        changed colour. This is especially clear in the steps, where the purple hue has become very
                        faint.</p>

                    <h2>Pine Trees and Wall in the Garden of the Asylum</h2>
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, October 1889</p>
                    <p>chalk on paper, 33.0 cm x 24.7 cm</p>
                    <p>The painting depicts a serene yet poignant scene of pine trees and a stone wall, capturing the
                        natural beauty of the surroundings. Van Gogh's trademark vibrant colors and energetic
                        brushstrokes convey both the calmness of nature and the underlying emotional intensity that
                        marked his time in the asylum.
                    </p>
                    <p>The composition of the painting reflects a sense of both confinement and connection with the
                        world outside. The stone wall may symbolize the boundaries and isolation van Gogh felt during
                        his time in the asylum, while the expansive, swirling sky and trees evoke a sense of life and
                        movement. The dynamic brushwork and bold colors in the painting illustrate van Gogh's ability to
                        express deep emotion through landscape, transforming a simple garden scene into a powerful
                        expression of his inner turmoil and resilience.</p>
