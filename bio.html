          <div class="tab-content" id="text1">
            <p>Vincent van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in the Brabant village of
              Zundert. Remarkably, he was named after an older brother, also called Vincent, who had been stillborn
              exactly one year earlier.His parents, Theodorus van Gogh, a Protestant minister, and Anna Carbentus, would
              go on to have six children in total: Vincent, three sisters (Anna, Wil, and Lies), and two brothers (Theo
              and Cor).</p>
            <p>The family loved exploring nature, often taking long walks in the area around Zundert. These outings
              nurtured in young Vincent a profound appreciation for the natural world, a passion that would later become
              central to his art.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text2">
            <p>At age eleven, Vincent moved from his village school in Zundert to a
              boarding school in Zevenbergen. Life at the boarding school was challenging, and he felt deeply unhappy,
              though he managed to complete his elementary schooling. He occasionally drew during these years, yet
              showed
              no clear signs of artistic talent.</p>
            <p>Two years later, at thirteen, he transferred to a secondary school in Tilburg, where he excelled in
              languages and achieved good marks overall. However, in the middle of his second academic year (1867-1868),
              Vincent left school for reasons that remain unknown. This would be the end of his formal schooling; he
              never
              returned to structured education again.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text3">
            <p>At sixteen, Vincent's uncle helped him secure a position as a trainee at
              the international art dealership Goupil & Cie, in The Hague. These early working years at Goupil are when
              we
              see the first surviving letters from Vincent. His time at the dealership laid the foundation for his
              understanding of art and the art world.</p>
            <p>In September 1872, Vincent began an important, life-long correspondence with his younger brother, Theo,
              who would later play a vital role in his life. By 1873, Theo was also working for Goupil, in Brussels,
              while
              Vincent was transferred to Goupil's London branch, marking the beginning of a new chapter in his life.</p>

          <div class="tab-content" id="text5">
            <p>Vincent van Gogh's first years as a young adult were spent in London, where he worked as an art dealer
              for the company Goupil & Cie. This job allowed him to explore famous museums like the British Museum and
              the National Gallery. He was fascinated by art, especially works by "peasant painters" like François
              Millet, who depicted the humble lives of common folk.</p>
            <p>Vincent read everything he could get his hands on: museum guides, magazines, literature, and poetry.
              However, despite his love of art, he grew frustrated
              with his job, and his employers sensed it. In 1876, they decided to let him go. This marked his first big
              career change.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text6">
            <p>After being dismissed from Goupil, Vincent traveled back to England and took up a new job as an assistant
              teacher at a boys' boarding school. Later, he became a schoolteacher at a private school run by a vicar
              near London, where he was allowed to preach at local villages. Though he enjoyed helping people, he found
              this job unfulfilling. During Christmas of 1876, Vincent's father advised him not to return to England, so
              he decided to look for new paths to pursue.</p>
            <p>In 1877, Vincent's Uncle Cent found him work at a bookstore in Dordrecht. By this time, he was becoming
              more and more religious, which worried his family. His parents agreed to let him try a new path and study
              theology to become a minister. Vincent moved to Amsterdam and began preparing for the entrance exam. He
              stayed with his uncle, who was also a minister, and tried his best to study.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text7">
            <p>Vincent struggled to focus on academics, preferring to roam the city and the countryside. Eventually, his
              uncle advised him to give up on theology, realizing that it wasn't the right fit for Vincent, and though
              he abandoned formal studies, Vincent's desire to help others persisted</p>
            <p> In 1880, he moved to the
              Borinage, a mining region in Belgium, to work as a lay preacher. Here, he taught classes, visited the
              sick, and gave Bible readings to support the miners and their families, who lived in extreme poverty.
              Vincent even adopted their lifestyle, sleeping on the floor and sharing what little he had. His compassion
              earned him the nickname "The Christ of the Coal Mine." Yet despite his dedication, Vincent couldn't form a
              committed group of followers, and his contract was not renewed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text8">
            <p>During his time in the Borinage, Vincent frequently sent letters to his younger brother Theo, often
              including little sketches and drawings. Theo, recognizing Vincent's talent, encouraged him to focus more
              on drawing, suggesting that he might serve others through art. Inspired by this advice, Vincent moved to
              Brussels in October 1880 to begin serious art training. He had no steady income, but Theo supported him
              financially, allowing him to work on his skills and connect with other artists. This moment marked the
              beginning of Vincent's journey to becoming an artist.</p>

            <p>In December 1883, Vincent van Gogh returned to live with his parents in Nuenen, Netherlands, where he set
              up a studio at the back of the house. A few months later, he moved to a larger space in the village with
              its rural landscape and hardworking farmers, provided Vincent with a rich setting for
              exploring peasant life through art. Here, he sketched and painted local farmers, weavers, and laborers at
              every opportunity, developing a “peasant painter” style. In early 1884, he proposed to his brother
              that he would exchange his paintings for an allowance, hoping he could sell them on the Paris art
              market. However, the dark tones of his work were not in line with French tastes at the time.</p>
            <p>Vincent's family life was challenging. His parents found it difficult to live with him due to his
              headstrong nature and unconventional appearance. In March 1885, shortly after his father's death, Vincent
              moved out of the family home to live in his studio, where he began working on The Potato Eaters. In late
              1885, he decided to pursue formal training at the Academy of Art in Antwerp, leaving the
              Netherlands for good.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text10">
            <p>Antwerp was a bustling city with much to offer an artist: quality materials, drawing clubs with models,
              and
              art-filled churches, museums, and galleries. Vincent enrolled at the Academy of Art, but he found its
              traditional teaching style limiting and frustrating. He felt that the academy's emphasis on conventional
              drawing techniques lacked the emotional depth he sought in his art. Vincent was especially critical of the
              academy's failure to appreciate classical statues, noting that his own work had a markedly different
              approach.</p>
            <p>Despite these frustrations, Antwerp exposed Vincent to the works of other artists and a range of artistic
              resources that would shape his developing style. His time here allowed him to expand his artistic
              knowledge and fueled his determination to create work that felt authentic to him. In early 1886, he
              decided to leave Antwerp and join his brother, Theo, in Paris.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text11">
            <p>Vincent arrived in Paris in February 1886, where he moved in with his brother Theo, who managed to secure
              a larger apartment. In Paris, he studied under Fernand Cormon, a respected artist with many foreign
              students, which allowed him to refine his skills in a more contemporary setting. Paris exposed him to the
              vibrant art scene of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, which valued color, light, and brushwork in
              ways
              Vincent hadn't yet explored.</p>
            <p>Meeting other artists and seeing new styles firsthand had a profound impact on his work. He began to
              incorporate brighter colors and lighter tones, shifting away from the earthy darkness of his earlier
              pieces in Nuenen. This period in Paris marked a major turning point for Vincent, setting him on the path
              to becoming the artist known for his expressive use of color and unique, emotive brushwork.</p>

          <div class="tab-content" id="text12">
            <p>Once Vincent arrived at the clinic in Saint-Rémy, he immediately began working again. On his good days,
              he often painted in the institution's walled garden and he was later allowed to work outside the hospital
              too. He was also given an extra room inside the clinic to use as a studio, where he produced a series of
              works, including copies of prints after paintings by artists like Rembrandt and Millet.</p>
            <p>Vincent's mental health continued to fluctuate. During one period of extreme confusion, he ate some of
              his
              oil paint, following which he was restricted to drawing for a while. Yet, Vincent was exceptionally
              productive at Saint-Rémy, where he completed around 150 paintings in the space of a year.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text13">
            <p>Vincent left the mental hospital in Saint-Rémy in May 1890 and headed north to Auvers-sur-Oise, where
              several artists were already residing. Auvers offered Vincent the peace and quiet he needed, while being
              close enough to Paris for him to visit his brother Theo. There was a doctor there too, Paul Gachet, who
              could keep an eye on him.</p>
            <p>Vincent quickly befriended Gachet, himself an amateur painter, who advised Van
              Gogh to devote himself completely to his art. He did precisely that, painting the gardens and wheatfields
              around the village at a feverish rate.Vincent threw himself entirely into his painting in this period,
              completing virtually a work a day. His
              health seemed to be improving, too.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="text14">
            <p>Vincent visited Theo and his family in Paris in early July 1890, where he learned that his brother was
              thinking of quitting his job at the art dealers' he had managed over many years. Theo wanted to set up his
              own business, which inevitably represented a certain financial risk. Vincent returned to Auvers a worried
              man.</p>
            <p>On 27 July 1890, he walked into a wheatfield and shot himself in the chest with a pistol. The wounded
              artist staggered back to his room at the Auberge Ravoux. Theo rushed from Paris to Auvers and was present
              when his brother died of his injuries. Vincent was buried at Auvers on 30 July 1890. His legacy
              was a large body of art works: over 850 paintings and almost 1,300 works on paper.</p>
